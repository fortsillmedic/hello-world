# hello-world
Just another repositoryI am very new at this. I am a Nurse looking for a career change. It is a bit scary venturing out into something I know little about. I am 41 years old and my only experience with computers are emails, the internet and EMR's. I hope to learn enough to allow me to integrate my nursing knowledge with computer programing and to be able to make a living off from it.
